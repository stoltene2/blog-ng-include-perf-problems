# blog-ng-include-perf-problems

There are two branches of interest here.

* master
* thin-directives

The `master` branch shows the slowness from the blog article at [my blog](http://eric.stolten.net).

The `thin-directives` branch is a refactored version of `master`.

## Build & development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.
